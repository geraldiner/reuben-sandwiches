My favorite Reuben, not only because it's the cheapest, but also because the energy at Angie's is unmatched.

I'm from Hawaiâ€˜i where we have the spirit of Aloha, and it was here that I realized that North Carolina has southern hospitality. And! You often can see Angie running around helping out.

Besides all that good stuff, their Reuben is top tier. I've even had people from other tables become envious of my order
