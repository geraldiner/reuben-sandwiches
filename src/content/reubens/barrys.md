A pretty close second! I believe this is where I had my first Reuben sandwich and it didn't disappoint. I love that they let you have it with potato chips because that's my preferred side.

And really, the _only_ reason I put this second is because I've noticed they haven't been consistent with the quality between the times I've been there.
