A solid reuben! I was pleasantly surprised to see this on the menu at the Cleveland Draft House. We were trying this place out for the first time, and my days is always made better when a Reuben is on the menu.

But this Reuben was not as good as the one at Angie's or Barry's. They have a Turkey Reuben, which I'll have to try next time.
